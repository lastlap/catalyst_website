				    <p>Chartered Accountancy (CA) is a prestigious professional qualification in the field of Accountancy, Taxation, Finance and Audit, offered by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). To become a CA, one needs to clear three levels of examination namely Foundation, Intermediate and Final along with three years of practical training (also known as articleship). A successful candidate will then become a member of ICAI and will be addressed with the prefix CA (it sticks with you for the rest of your life!).</p>

					<p> Sounds very simple. Doesn’t it? You might be thinking <em>“Yeah I got this, easy peasy”</em>
					</p>

					<p> Hold On Tiger! This is where things get pretty interesting.</p>

					<p> You will be amazed to know that in a country of over 130 crore people, we only have over 3 lakh CAs. That is 0.02% of the total population. </p>

					<p> DAMN! WHY SO?</p>

					<p> Well is it because nobody takes up CA?
					</p>

					<p>Nope! <b><u><em>It’s because not many end up clearing CA exams.</em></u></b></p>

					<p>
						CA is considered as one of the <b><em>toughest course</em></b> in India. The pass percentages of the different levels average around 10-15%. (I am being very liberal with these numbers, sometimes it even goes down to 4-5%).
					</p>

					<p>
						So I am not here persuade you to take up CA. Just to give you a few pointers why CA might be a good career choice for you.
					</p>

					<p>
						<ol>
							<li><b>MONEY AND RESPECT -</b> Obviously there is a lot of money to be made but more importantly CA’s command a lot of respect in the Indian economic diaspora. Companies pay top dollars to get opinions of CAs on how to turnaround their businesses.</li>
							<li><b>JOB PROSPECTS -</b> All industries and organization require CAs for its accounting department. The job prospect of this field is very much brighter. As a CA, you can work in government or public service undertakings as well as the private sector companies. You can also have an option to either be employed with a firm as an employee or you can choose to open your own private practice. (The word “Recession” doesn’t exist in the dictionary of a CA.) </li>
							<li><b>COST EFFECTIVE -</b>Pursuing Chartered Accountancy is not an expensive affair at all. The estimated total cost to complete the course along with classes come to around Rs 3 lakhs. What makes it even more lucrative is that fact that you even end up earning money during your practical training of 3 years. (That is a win-win). Lower Cost coupled with higher salary prospects provides this course with a higher ROI (Return on Investment) than many other degrees in our country.</li>
							<li><b>YOU GET PAID FOR YOUR SIGNATURE -</b> All public and private companies in India require their Financial Statements to be audited by CAs. This has been mandated by law. So by becoming a CA and getting the power to sign Financial Statement and Audit Reports, you become an ambassador of the Government in ensuring Financial Transparency in the economy.</li>
							<li><b>TAX PLANNING -</b> India is growing into a super economy and along with that India is going to see a rise in the level of income of its people. This means there is going to be a lot of folks, who would want someone to help them with saving taxes. Being a CA gives you the knowledge and expertise to help people in their tax planning and ensuring their compliance with the Income tax laws of the country.</li>
						</ol>
					</p>

					<p><em>
						As it is rightly said that, CA is not a tough course. It is a course for tough people. And of course it is hard. It is supposed to be hard. If it was easy, everyone would do it.<b><u> Hard is what makes it great.</u></b>
					</em>
