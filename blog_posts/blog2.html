				    <p>When Sapna approached me with the idea of Catalyst Muscat, it sounded perfect. A career guidance and mentorship program for students in Oman was something much needed. Only a few students are fortunate enough to have a mentor who can guide them on the numerous career paths open to them, and I was lucky enough to be one.</p>

					<p> I’m a sophomore at Lady Shri Ram College majoring in Statistics Honors with a minor in Economics. Through this blog, I will be detailing my journey from ISWK to LSR and covering two main questions –
					</p>

					<ol>
						<li> Why Delhi University(DU)? </li>
						<li> Why Statistics? </li>
					</ol>


					<p> I got acquainted with Delhi University in grade 11, through my brother. On researching more about the university, I noticed some of their top colleges had ridiculously high cut-offs – some even at 100%! Being a commerce student, it was my dream to land up in one of the prestigious colleges like SRCC, LSR, St. Stephens, and a few others. I remember spending hours watching YouTube videos on these colleges, little did I know that two years later I would be attending classes at my dream college, LSR! </p>

					<p> College life is not only about academics, it’s also about campus life, extra-curricular activities, events, and fests – and DU seemed to be a one-stop destination for all this. Delhi University has consistently been one of the best universities in India as it offers a myriad of opportunities for its students. Once the 12th grade results were out, I was ecstatic as I had a strong chance of getting into a good DU college. (Do note that DU considers the marks of the top 4 subjects only with English mandatory). </p>

					<p> While filling out the application forms, we are allowed to give all the course options we are interested in applying. I had applied for 4 courses – Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, and B.Com (all honors courses). It is mandatory to have studied Mathematics in grade 12 to opt for an honors course, which is deemed superior to an ordinary course. Soon, the cutoffs for various colleges were released and I faced a major dilemma in choosing which course to opt for and in which college. On consulting several connections and getting varied perspectives, I realized that some students choose ‘course over college’ because according to them, the ultimate goal is to work in a field which one loves. But some others choose ‘college over course’ as they feel college plays a significant role in developing one's personality and brand image. So really, there is no one correct answer, it totally depends on the student. </p>

					<p> I finally narrowed my course and college preferences as per the cutoffs to either ‘Statistics at LSR’ or ‘Economics at Hansraj College’. So why did I eventually choose Statistics at LSR?
						<ul>
							<li>Data is the new oil of the 21st century. The entire world is made up of data. The scope of statistics is broad, ranging from business and banking to even astronomy and psychology!</li>
							<li>Delhi University offers the option of taking up a minor course along with a major – I chose Economics as my minor (solved the problem of which course to select – took up both!)</li>
							<li>LSR offers exceptional placements, lectures, an amazing crowd, and its clubs and societies are not just one of the best in DU, but the whole country. The culture at LSR can be clearly judged by its distinguished alumni.</li>
						</ul>
						
					</p>

					<p>Life at DU has its own ups and downs – sometimes you could be so busy that you won’t even know how quickly a year has gone by. Truly, DU is the most vibrant campus in the country, and being a part of it could change you completely and make you so much more confident and prepared for the future.</p>

					<p>

All the Best!
